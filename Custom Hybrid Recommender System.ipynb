Being able to choose among a plethora of libraries that allow for effective deployment of recommendation engines, I had a hard time choosing the most proper ones.\n",

Not only it is a long running project (previous versions being available in the java programming language), but it was developed with MovieLens dataset in mind, resulting in really useful implementations that allow for easier data manipulation when it comes to datasets like Movielens.\n",

LightFM is a workframe allowing for experimentation using the very robust and adjustable hybrid recommendation algorith with the same name. In this way, we will able to run the most popular recommendation algorithms using the Lenskit API and then comparing them to the LightFM algorithm, fed with custom metadata and adjusted for other custom recommendation algorithms."

Lenskit library follows the most popular approach by constructing a candidates set, containing all the movies eligible to be recommended to a user. Then, ratings are predicted for all the members of the candidates set and the top-N rated movies are being suggested to the user. All the top-N evaluation metrics are applied by comparing the test set interactions (user ratings for specific users) with the ranking of the candidates.\n",

For each user that appears in the test set, all the movies that appeared in the train set and have not been interacted with by the specific user, are eligible for suggestion. Ratings given by each test user for the movies he has not interacted with in the train set, are being calculated with the algorithm of choice, then highest rated movies are suggested for each user."

        "  Even though, our recommendation approach is really intuitive and widely accepted, it suffers from some minor limitations. They have to do with the fact that most recommendation libraries (including LightFM and Lenskit), produce folds by seperating user interactions (in our case ratings) into the train and test sets with a specified ratio. They don't take into consideration the nature of the items that are being interacted with.\n",
        "\n",
        " Specifically, Lenskit and LightFM don't guarantee that movies contained in the test set's interactions, appear in some train interactions. This, combined with the candidates set policy described above, makes it impossible for top-N recommendation algorithms to suggest movies not contained in the train set. In most cases, train set contains a solid majority of all interactions, meaning it is very improbable for a movie in the test set to not appear in the train set. Most movies that do so, are very obscure and have been interacted with a very small number of users, implying that they won't have a big effect on the evaluation metrics values, affecting the quality of recommendation lists for handful users."
